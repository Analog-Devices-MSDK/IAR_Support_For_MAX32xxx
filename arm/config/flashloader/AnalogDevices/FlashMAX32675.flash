  <args_doc>The "--div" argument can by used to set the flash controller divider.
The value of the flash controller divider is used to generate a 1 microsecond width pulse from the system clock source.
This pulse is used when performing write or erase operations on the flash memory. This field should be set to
the system clock source frequency in MHz (or as close as possible) for example, if the system clock is running at
120MHz, this field should be set to 120.</args_doc>
